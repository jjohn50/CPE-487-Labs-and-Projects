Lab 2: Four-Digit Hex Counter

Build a four-digit (16-bit) counter to display its value on 7-segment displays (See Section 10.1 Seven-Segment Display of the refenece manual https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/programmable-logic/nexys-4-ddr/reference-manual)
1. Create a new project hex4counter in Vivado

    Click 'Add Files' then add leddec.vhd

    Click 'Create File' then create two new source files of file type VHDL called counter and hexcount

    Create a new constraint file of file type XDC called hexcount

    Choose Nexys 4 DDR board for the project

    Click 'Finish'

    Click design sources and copy the VHDL code from counter.vhd and hexcount.vhd

    Click constraints and copy the code from hexcount.xdc

2. Run synthesis
3. Run implementation
4. Open implemented design

    Tools > Edit Device Properties > Configuration Modes > Check "Master SPIx1"

5. Generate bitstream, open hardware manager, and program device

    Click 'Generate Bitstream'

    Click 'Open Hardware Manager' and click 'Open Target' then 'Auto Connect'

    Click 'Program Device' then xc7a100t_0 to download hexcount.bit to the Nexys 4 DDR board

    Move the blue MODE jumper from JTAG to QSPI

    The four digit counter counts from 0000 to FFFF

6. Generate memory configuration file

    Tools > Generate Memory Configuration File > Format: MCS, Memory Part: s25fl128sxxxxxx0-spi-x1-x2-x4, Filename: hexcount.mcs, Load bitstream files: hexcount.bit, check "Overwrite"

    Open Hardware Manager > Add Configuration Memory Device > xc7a100t_0 > Memory Device: s25fl128sxxxxxx0-spi-x1-x2-x4 > "Do you want to program the configuration memory device now?" > OK > Memory Device: s25fl128sxxxxxx0-spi-x1-x2-x4, Configuration file: hexcount.mcs, PRM file: hexcount.prm, Address Range: Entire Configuration Memory Device > OK > "Flash programming completed successfully." > OK

    Right click xc7a100t_0 under "Hardware" > Boot from Configuration Memory Device > POWER OFF > POWER ON > POWER OFF > Move the blue MODE jumper from QSPI to JTAG
