Lab 5: DAC Siren

Program the FPGA on the Nexys 4 DDR board to generate a wailing audio siren using a digital-to-analog (DAC) converter called Pmod Inter-IC Sound (I2S) with a headphone or speaker connected to the top pins of the Pmod port JA (See Section 11 of the reference manual https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/programmable-logic/nexys-4-ddr/reference-manual)
1. Create a new RTL project Siren in Vivado Quick Start

    Create four new source files of file type VHDL called dac_if, tone, wail, and siren

    Create a new constraint file of file type XDC called siren

    Choose Nexys 4 DDR board for the project

    Click 'Finish'

    Click design sources and copy the VHDL code from dac_if.vhd, tone.vhd, wail.vhd, siren.vhd

    Click constraints and copy the code from siren.xdc

2. Run synthesis
3. Run implementation and open implemented design
4. Generate bitstream, open hardware manager, and program device

    Click 'Generate Bitstream'

    Click 'Open Hardware Manager' and click 'Open Target' then 'Auto Connect'

    Click 'Program Device' then xc7a100t_0 to download siren.bit to the Nexys 4 DDR board

5. Change the upper and lower tone limits

    Modify the tone module to create a square wave instead of a triangle wave when the upper push button (BTNU) is depressed

    Add this push button as an input to siren.vhd and pass its value down to the tone module

    Get the correct pin number for this push button from the Nexys 4 DDR Reference Manual

    Note the difference in the quality of the tone when switching to a square wave tone

6. Change the wailing speed

    Use the eight slide switches (SW0-SW7) on the Nexys 4 DDR board to set the wailing speed

    Add these as inputs to siren.vhd

    Get the correct pin numbers for these switches from the Nexys 4 DDR Reference Manual

7. Add a second wail instance to drive the right audio channel

    Use different high and low tone limits and wailing speed for the right audio channel
