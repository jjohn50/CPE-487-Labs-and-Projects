Lab 1: Seven-segment decoder

    Built a single-digit (4-bit) hex counter to display its value on both four-digit common anode seven-segment LED displays (See Section 10.1 Seven-Segment Display of the reference manual https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/programmable-logic/nexys-4-ddr/reference-manual)

Project 1 - LED decoder
1. Create a new RTL project leddec in Vivado Quick Start

    Create a new source file of file type VHDL called leddec

    Create a new constraint file of file type XDC called leddec

    Choose Nexys 4 DDR board for the project

    Click 'Finish'

    Click design sources and copy the VHDL code from leddec.vhd

    Click constraints and copy the code from leddec.xdc

2. Run synthesis
3. Run implementation and open implemented design
4. Generate bitstream, open hardware manager, and program device

    Click 'Generate Bitstream'

    Click 'Open Hardware Manager' and click 'Open Target' then 'Auto Connect'

    Click 'Program Device' then xc7a100t_0 to download leddec.bit to the Nexys 4 DDR board

5. Slider switches on the Nexys 4 DDR board

    Slider switches 6 and 7 to determine which dsiplay is illuminated

    Slider switches 0, 1, 2, and 3 to select the value of 4-bit hex digit

Project 2 - Hex counter

    Build a 4-bit counter to display a hex character

1. Create a new project hexcounter in Vivado

    Click 'Add Files' then add leddec.vhd

    Click 'Create File' then create two new source files of file type VHDL called counter and hexcount

    Create a new constraint file of file type XDC called hexcount

    Choose Nexys 4 DDR board for the project

    Click 'Finish'

    Click design sources and copy the VHDL code from counter.vhd and hexcount.vhd

    Click constraints and copy the code from hexcount.xdc

2. Run synthesis
3. Run implementation and open implemented design
4. Generate bitstream, open hardware manager, and program device

    Click 'Generate Bitstream'

    Click 'Open Hardware Manager' and click 'Open Target' then 'Auto Connect'

    Click 'Program Device' then xc7a100t_0 to download hexcount.bit to the Nexys 4 DDR board

    The least significant 7-segment decoder counts cycles from 0 to F
